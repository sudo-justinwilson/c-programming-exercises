## Exercises from K&R

Here lies my answers to the exercises from [K&R's C Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%26R) book. 

Sometimes, the logic in some of the code comes in handy to me.

The format of the filenames are:
```
exercise1-16.3.c
```
`1` = the chapter

`16` = the exercise

`3`  = the version (iterations until desired outcome was met)
